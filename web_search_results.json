Since then, shares have largely recovered to their level before the report, leaving them about 23% higher for the year so far at $186.68 in Thursday afternoon trading.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's third-quarter revenue to come in at $157.27 billion, up from the prior quarter and year-ago period.

        "text": "Major Indexes Post Monthly Losses The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each finished October with monthly losses. For the Dow and S&P 500, it marked the end of five-month winning streaks, while the Nasdaq had its first down month since July. TradingView\n\nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Thursday Decliners The steepest drop in the S&P 500 hit shares of Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest military shipbuilding company in the U.S., which sank 26.2%. Third-quarter revenue and earnings per share (EPS) fell short of analysts' estimates, and Huntington Ingalls reduced its full-year sales forecast. The company said uncertainty about agreements with the U.S. Navy, as well as labor and supply chain issues, contributed to a weaker outlook for its shipbuilding business.\n\n(HII), the largest military shipbuilding company in the U.S., which sank 26.2%.

Shares of automotive technology supplier Aptiv (APTV) dropped 17.7% following the company's third-quarter earnings release. Production challenges across the car industry, reduced customer scheduling, and bumps along the road to an electric vehicle (EV) future weighed on Aptiv's performance. Still, the company said it has adopted cost-cutting measures to adapt to the difficult environment. Advancers Paycom Software (PAYC) shares skyrocketed on Thursday, posting the top daily performance in the S&P 500 with a gain of 21.3%.

The iPhone maker delivered record September-period revenue of $94.93 billion, up 6% year-over-year and above the $94.58 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Net income was $14.74 billion, or 97 cents per share, below expectations of $22.49 billion, or $1.48 per share. After stripping out a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion to reflect the impact of the reversal of the European General Court\u2019s State Aid decision, adjusted EPS came in at $1.46. Apple produced $46.22 billion in iPhone revenue, above expectations of $45.32 billion. However, the iPhone 16\u2019s September 20 release date came with less than two weeks to go in the quarter, meaning the bulk of that came from iPhone 15 and older models. The new iPhone 16 is displayed at an unveiling event at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters on Sept. 9, 2024. David Paul Morris / Bloomberg / Getty Images The results come as the company is rolling out Apple Intelligence features, including a free iOS update for the iPhone 16 and other devices released Monday. Shares of Apple were down 2% in recent after-hours trading. -Andrew Kessel\n\nAmazon Jumps After Hours on Earnings Beat, Cloud Growth Amazon (AMZN) stock jumped in extended trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results driven by growth in its cloud and advertising businesses. The company reported net sales of $158.9 billion, up 11% from the year-ago period and above the $157.3 billion Wall Street expected, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Earnings per share (EPS) grew more than 50% to $1.43, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts. Amazon stock rose nearly 5% in extended trading on Thursday, after declining more than 3% in the regular session. Still, shares were up 22% for the year before the stock\u2019s post-earnings jump, slightly outpacing the Nasdaq Composite over the same period. TradingView Revenue at Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing unit, rose 19% to $27.4 billion, roughly in line with expectations. The division\u2019s revenue growth has accelerated into the high teens this year after holding in the low teens in 2023. Amazon forecast fourth-quarter net sales would be within a range of $183.5 billion to $188.5 billion, the midpoint of which sat slightly below the $186.4 billion figure analysts were expecting, per Visible Alpha.\n\nAdvertising sales increased 19% to $14.3 billion, about in line with analysts' expectations for one of Amazon\u2019s greenest and fastest-growing revenue streams. Capital expenditures (CapEx) increased 5% from last year to $22.2 billion. Amazon, locked in an AI arms race with cloud-computing peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), has significantly boosted its spending on data center infrastructure this year.\n\n-Colin Laidley\n\nIntel Jumps in Extended Trading as Sales Top Estimates Intel (INTC) reported third-quarter revenue that topped analysts' expectations, sending shares higher after the bell Thursday despite widening losses. The chipmaker's third-quarter revenue fell 6% year-over-year to $13.3 billion, above the $13.03 billion consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Intel posted a wider-than-expected loss of $16.6 billion, after reporting a $1.61 billion loss in the second quarter as the chipmaker works to cut costs. A year ago, the chipmaker had reported a profit of around $300 million. Intel said it anticipates fourth-quarter revenue of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, compared to a consensus estimate of $13.66 billion. It projects a loss of 24 cents per share, steeper than the loss of 12 cents per share analysts had been expecting. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during the Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 4, 2024. Annabelle Chih / Bloomberg / Getty Images Intel's results come as the storied chipmaker tries to turn around the business after losing market share to competitors and missing key opportunities to benefit from the boom in demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Shares took a hit in recent months as worries mounted about its ability to engineer a comeback after reporting wider-than-expected losses in the prior quarter and announcing massive layoffs. Intel shares were up 9% in recent after-hours trading. The stock was down more than 57% for the year through Thursday's close, making it one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of the year. -Kara Greenberg\n\n\n\nWhat Analysts Think of Apple Heading Into Earnings Apple (AAPL) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, with a majority of analysts bullish on the stock going into the company\u2019s first report since the iPhone 16\u2019s release last month. Of the 15 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have \u201cbuy\u201d or equivalent ratings, four have \u201chold\u201d ratings, and two have \u201csell.\u201d Their consensus price estimate is $240.87. Apple shares were down 1.4% at $226.90 in late trading Thursday. -Andrew Kessel\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Stock Dives on China Softness, Dividend Cut Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL) shares tanked 20% Thursday after the luxury beauty products maker warned about softness in China and the Asia travel market, pulled its full-year guidance, and cut its dividend. The news came a day after the company named Executive Group President St\u00e9phane de La Faverie its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective Jan. 1. Est\u00e9e Lauder reported fiscal 2025 first-quarter revenue fell 4% year-over-year to $3.36 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expected $3.37 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14 exceeded forecasts. Organic sales declined 5%, which the company blamed primarily on \"worsened consumer sentiment in China that drove further softening in overall prestige beauty in mainland China and low conversion rates in Asia travel retail and Hong Kong SAR.\" Organic sales were also dragged down by \"lower replenishment orders in Asia travel retail, including inventory pressure given the further retail market deceleration.\" Faris Hadziq / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images Est\u00e9e Lauder explained that because of the \"complex prestige beauty landscape\" and uncertainty about the recovery of the China and Asia travel markets, it was reducing its quarterly dividend to $0.35 from $0.66.3 In addition, it cited those factors, plus the change in leadership, for the decision to withdraw its fiscal 2025 outlook. It previously had anticipated adjusted EPS of $2.75 to $2.95, and revenue \"between a decrease of 1% to an increase of 2% versus the prior year.\" -Bill McColl\n\nRobinhood Stock Sinks as Promotions Hurt Earnings Robinhood Markets (HOOD) shares sank 15% Thursday, a day after the online brokerage posted worse-than-expected results as a promotion to get more customers affected performance. The company posted third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17, with revenue jumping 36% year-over-year to $637 million. Both were short of consensus forecasts by analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Robinhood said that revenue was reduced by $27 million \"due to matches paid to customers on transfers and deposits.\" CFO Jason Warnick said in the earnings call that these \"contra revenues\" are anticipated to grow sequentially by a similar amount in the current quarter, before slowing next year, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Warnick noted that the company's gold deposit boost \"has not driven as much incremental customer activity as our other promotions.\" Still, Robinhood noted that an increase in gold subscriptions was the primary reason its \"other revenues\" gained 42%. Transaction-based revenues were up 72% on higher options, cryptocurrency, and equities trades. Net interest revenues climbed 9%. TradingView Shares of Robinhood Markets fell from a nearly three-year high, but even so, they're up almost 90% year-to-date. They got a boost earlier this week when the company announced it was offering clients the ability to trade on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. -Bill McColl\n\nMicrosoft Stock Slumps on Disappointing Forecast Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) slid on Thursday after the company\u2019s revenue forecast fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates and the cloud computing giant struggles to meet demand. Shares were down nearly 6% Thursday morning, weighing on the shares of some of its Big Tech peers. The slump slashed the stock's year-to-date gain\u2014once as high as 24%\u2014to just 8%. Microsoft on Wednesday forecast revenue at its Intelligent Cloud division would grow 18% to 20% in the current quarter, below analysts\u2019 estimates. Growth of Azure, its cloud-computing platform, is expected to come in around 31% or 32%, a deceleration from the most recent quarter and slightly slower than Wall Street expected. The disappointing forecast overshadowed the company\u2019s fiscal first-quarter results, which broadly exceeded expectations. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the company event on AI technologies in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. Dimas Ardian / Bloomberg / Getty Images Microsoft has struggled to meet surging AI demand, a difficulty executives expect to persist in the current quarter. CFO Amy Hood on the company's earnings call expressed confidence that growth would pick up in the first half of next year as more cloud computing capacity came online. Analysts on Thursday were sanguine about the outlook. They pointed to comments from executives indicating demand for AI services remains strong, and that the company\u2019s increased spending on AI infrastructure should help it to meet that demand in the future.

Peloton reported a net loss of just $1 million, an improvement of $158 million year-over-year and much narrower than the $51.7 million loss expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Revenue of $586.0 million also surpassed projections. Stern, who currently serves as president of Ford Integrated Services and previously was an executive at Apple (AAPL), will begin his new roles on Jan. 1. In May, Peloton announced Barry McCarthy was stepping down as CEO and that the board had \"initiated a comprehensive search process\" to find its next leader. With today's surge, Peloton has gained 35% in 2024, far outpacing the S&P 500's gains. -Rob McLean\n\nUber Stock Plunges as Q3 Bookings Numbers Disappoint Uber Technologies (UBER) shares fell sharply early Thursday after the ride-hailing giant posted weaker-than-expected gross bookings in the third quarter. The company said gross bookings rose 16% year-over-year to $41 billion in the third quarter, below estimates from Visible Alpha of $41.3 billion. Trips grew 17% to 2.9 billion, in line with estimates. Uber's top- and bottom-line results handily beat analysts' estimates, however. The company reported revenue for the period of $11.19 billion versus the $10.98 billion estimate. Net income of $2.6 billion also beat estimates by a wide margin, although that included a $1.7 billion pre-tax benefit from gains in Uber's revaluation of its equity investments. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted that the company is continuing \"to advance our autonomous strategy.\" Uber has announced a number of partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies like Waymo over the last several months. TradingView Uber shares were down 9% in recent trading. The stock, which hit a record high three weeks ago, has gained 17% since the start of the year.\n\n-Nisha Gopalan\n\nCarvana Levels to Watch as Stock Surges After Earnings Carvana (CVNA) shares soared in premarket trading after the online car dealer blew past Wall Street\u2019s third-quarter earnings estimates and raised its full-year outlook. The stock has recently reclaimed the 200-week moving average and sits poised to break out above the upper trendline of a rising wedge pattern. The stock was up 19% at around $246 about 45 minutes before Thursday's opening bell. Source: TradingView.com. Investors should monitor key overhead price levels on Carvana's chart around $240, $300, and $365. During retracements, investors should closely monitor the $165 level, a location where the shares would likely attract buying interest near the September 2020 pullback low and January 2022 countertrend high.
